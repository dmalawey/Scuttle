## Python ([SCUTTLE/software/python](https://github.com/MXET/SCUTTLE/tree/master/software/python))

The python folder stores all the code needed to drive the SCUTTLE robot using simplified functions allowing the user to perform motor functions such as driving and turning as well as reading sensor values from onboard sensors and external sensors like the rotary encoders and compass. Using these functions helps anyone start writing their own programs for the SCUTTLE robot as quickly as possible.

## MATLAB ([SCUTTLE/software/matlab](https://github.com/MXET/SCUTTLE/tree/master/software/matlab))

The MATLAB folder contains the MATLAB Controller Client that allows a user to control the SCUTTLE robot manually as well as show sensor readings and plot the live position of the SCUTTLE robot.
